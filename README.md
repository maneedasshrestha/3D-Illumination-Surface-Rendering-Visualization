# 3D Illumination & Surface Rendering Visualization

## Project Overview

This project aims to simplify the understanding of illumination and surface rendering methods using **Three.js**. The web application provides an interactive 3D environment where users can explore different rendering techniques on various 3D shapes.

## Live Demo

The project is live at: [Illumination & Surface Rendering](https://illumination-surface-rendering.vercel.app/)

## Features

- **Shape Selection Grid:** Choose from a variety of 3D shapes displayed in a grid layout.
- **Seamless Transition:** Upon selecting a shape, it smoothly transitions into an interactive 3D canvas.
- **Customizable Rendering:** Side panel toggles allow users to adjust rendering settings:
  - Toggle mesh visibility
  - Enable/disable ambient reflection
  - Enable/disable diffuse reflection
  - Enable/disable specular reflection
- **Interactive Controls:** The selected shape responds to mouse movements, enhancing the visualization experience.
- **Modern & Mobile-Friendly UI:** The interface is designed with a sleek, responsive layout, making it usable across various devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Three.js** - For rendering 3D graphics
- **React** - For building a responsive and interactive UI
- **TypeScript** - For type safety and maintainability
- **shadcn-ui** - For UI components
- **Tailwind CSS** - For styling and responsiveness
